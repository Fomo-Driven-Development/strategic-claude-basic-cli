### Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| M1 | Week 1 | CLI framework and project structure complete |
| M2 | Week 2 | Core services implemented and tested |
| M3 | Week 3 | Status command fully functional |
| M4 | Week 4 | Init command complete and reliable |
| M5 | Week 5 | Clean command implemented |
| M6 | Week 6 | All features complete, documentation ready |
| M7 | Week 7 | v1.0.0 release |

### Success Criteria

#### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:
- All features implemented and tested
- No critical bugs or security issues
- Documentation updated
- Code review completed
- Performance meets requirements

#### Overall Success Metrics
- [ ] All four commands (init, clean, status, completions) working (3/4 complete: init ✅, clean ✅, status ✅, completions ⏳)
- [x] Installation completes in under 30 seconds
- [x] Zero data loss during operations
- [x] --force-core preserves user content reliably (archives/, issues/, plan/, research/, summary/)
- [x] Clear error messages for all failure modes
- [ ] Shell completions work in major shells
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Git clone failures**: Implement retry logic and better error handling
- **Symlink compatibility**: Test on multiple platforms, use relative paths
- **Permission issues**: Clear error messages, validation checks

#### Schedule Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined MVP, defer additional features
- **Dependency issues**: Minimize external dependencies
- **Testing complexity**: Automate testing, use mocks for complex scenarios

### Future Enhancements (Post v1.0)
- Configuration file support
- Selective directory customization (beyond core/guides/templates framework directories)
- Update command for strategic-claude-basic-template content
- Multiple framework support
- Integration with package managers
- Web-based status dashboard
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

### Development Principles
1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds working functionality
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests alongside implementation
3. **User-Focused**: Prioritize user experience and clear feedback
4. **Reliability First**: Prefer reliable operations over advanced features
5. **Version Stability**: Pin to specific commits for predictable installations
6. **Documentation**: Keep documentation current with implementation

### Communication Plan
- Weekly progress updates
- Demo after each major milestone
- User feedback collection during beta phase
- Regular architecture reviews
- Security review before release
